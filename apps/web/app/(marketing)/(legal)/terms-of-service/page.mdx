Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to
your Purchase, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your

Any contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made
available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from
these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the

### 5. Accounts

When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of
18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current
at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the
immediate termination of your account on Service.

activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether
your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us
immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of
your account.

### 6. Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic
basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual
basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a
Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or SEO
Bot AI cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
online account management page or by contacting Turboship customer support team.

Turboship offers a free plan that includes one free article. With the free plan,
you can experience the usage of Turboship and have one article written for your
blog. There is no need to enter your billing information or worry about any
charges during this free usage period. If you wish to continue using Turboship
and access additional features, you can upgrade to a paid subscription plan.

### 8. Fee Changes

Turboship, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees
for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the
end of the then-current Billing Cycle. Turboship will provide you with a
reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into
