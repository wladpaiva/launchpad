# Hey there! üëã
# This is an example of the configuration file for the repo.
# Projects have a symlink to this file so you can just copy it to .env.local and fill in the values during development.
# 
# üíú  - Required
# ü©µ  - Optional in development, required in production
# ü§ç  - Optional

# ü§ç  BACKGROUND JOBS
# This is the configuration for the background jobs server. It's optional and if not set the server will
# just skip running background jobs.
# Altough it's optional, it's HIGHLY recommended to set it up specifically if you use
# Vercel for hosting with their 10s timeout on free plans.
# 
# This repo already comes with a development server in the docker-compose so after running `bun run setup`,
# head to `http://localhost:3030` and create a user to be able to login to the dashboard and get the API key.
# If you prefer to use their cloud service, you can sign up for a free account at https://trigger.dev, create
# a project and get the API key from there instead then set the URL to `https://cloud.trigger.dev`.
# 
# NOTE: Trigger.dev currently only supports serverless functions. If you want to deploy the projects to a
# long running server, you'll have to implement a different service. 
# @see https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/discussions/430

# 
# ü§ç  TUNNELING FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# This is the subdomain used for local development. It's optional and if not set, the tunneling will generate
# a random subdomain for you. If you want to use a specific subdomain, set it here and make sure it's unique
# across all developers. (this is useful when testing webhooks locally in conjunction with the background jobs)
