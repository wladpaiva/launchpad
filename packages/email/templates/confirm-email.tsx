            I'm working hard to get everything ready for you. I want to make
            sure that you have a great experience from the start.

            I'll be in touch soon with more details. For now, I want to ask 2

            Why? I clean out this email list often. I need to make sure you
            aren't a spam bot that automatically filled out the form on the site
            (Why do people create those bots in the first place? Beats me).

            Why? To help me out, and so you receive what you subscribed to.
